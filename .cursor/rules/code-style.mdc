# Valet Project Conventions

## Component Preferences:

- Keep components as Server Components by default in Next.js
- Only convert to Client Components when interactivity is necessary
- Use `'use client'` directive only when required

## Form Handling:

- Prefer react-hook-form and Zod for form validation
- Handle onSubmit in the same component file, not in separate action files
- Use existing dependencies rather than installing new libraries

## Package Management:

- Use pnpm as the package manager
- Run lint commands with `pnpm lint`
- Check for errors with `pnpm lint` before committing

## Database:

- Always use existing database, never create new ones
- Request environment variables from project admin when needed
